## BERT Model

* BERT is a method of **pre-training language representations**, meaning that we **train a general-purpose *language understanding model*** on a large text corpus (like Wikipedia) and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks.**

* BERT was created and **published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google**. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks.**

* **BERT is a Transformer-based model.** 
    * The architecture of BERT is similar to the original Transformer model, except that BERT has two separate Transformer models: one for the left-to-right direction (the “encoder”) and one for the right-to-left direction (the “encoder”). 
    * The output of each model is the hidden state output by the final Transformer layer. The two models are pre-trained jointly on a large corpus of unlabeled text. The pre-training task is a simple and straightforward masked language modeling objective.
    * The pre-trained BERT model can then be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.
