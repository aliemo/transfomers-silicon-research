## BERT Model

### Description
BERT is a method of pre-training language representations, meaning that we train a general-purpose "language understanding" model on a large text corpus (like Wikipedia) and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks. BERT was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7 (5.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5% absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1% absolute improvement).

### Architecture

BERT is a Transformer-based model. The architecture of BERT is similar to the original Transformer model, except that BERT has two separate Transformer models: one for the left-to-right direction (the “encoder”) and one for the right-to-left direction (the “encoder”). The output of each model is the hidden state output by the final Transformer layer. The two models are pre-trained jointly on a large corpus of unlabeled text. The pre-training task is a simple and straightforward masked language modeling objective. The pre-trained BERT model can then be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.
